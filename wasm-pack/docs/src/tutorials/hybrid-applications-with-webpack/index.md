The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the [`rust-webpack-template`]
and the `wasm-pack` workflow by building the example app in the template.

This tutorial is aimed at folks who are both beginners to WebAssembly and Rust- you don't need
much Rust knowledge to complete this tutorial.

Be sure to have read and followed the [Prerequisites](../../prerequisites/index.html).

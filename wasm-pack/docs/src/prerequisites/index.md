# Prerequisites

First you'll want to [install the `wasm-pack` CLI][wasm-pack], and `wasm-pack
-V` should print the version that you just installed.

Next, since `wasm-pack` is a build tool, you'll want to make sure you have
[Rust][rust] installed. Make sure `rustc -V` prints out at least 1.30.0.

Finally, if you're using `wasm-pack` to publish to NPM, you'll want
to [install and configure `npm`][npm]. In the future, we intend to rewrite the
npm registry client bits so that the need for a Node runtime is eliminated. If
you're excited about that work- you should reach out to the maintainers and get
involved!

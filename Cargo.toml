# rustc supports two "optimize for size" levels:  opt-level = "s" and "z". 
# These names were inherited from clang / LLVM and are not too descriptive
# but "z" is meant to give the idea that it produces smaller binaries than "s".
# https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/unsorted/speed-vs-size.html#optimize-for-size
opt-level = "z"

# by compiling as a single codegen unit (i.e. not in parallel),
# it's possible to reduce size even further at the expense of
# compilation time
codegen-units = 1

# by enabling link-time optimization, we can reduce size even further
# by telling cargo to optimize at the link stage (in addition to the
# normal optimizations during the compilation stage)

# by overriding our dependencies' compilation settings, we can further optimize for size
